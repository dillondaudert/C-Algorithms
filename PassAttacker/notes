##Google's Password Attacker algorithm

####Pseudocode
For any combination of N characters having M length, how many possible combinations are there?

A character is allowed to repeat a maximum of N - M + 1 times, referred to as the rIndex (repeat index)

```
FIND_NUM_POSSIBLE(M, N)
rIndex = M - N + 1
i = 1
total = 1
for i to M
	if i <= rIndex
		total *= N
	else		
		total = total/N * (N - (i - rIndex)) + 
			(total - N) * 
	
	
	
```
