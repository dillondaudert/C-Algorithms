#Password Attacker
##An answer to one of Google's code test at code.google.com

passAttack.c is a reduced version of my first attempt using a full tree structure, 
since in working through it the first time, I came up with the second. Unfortunately, 
it is still not efficient enough to solve the problem with 1 <= N <= M <= ~14.

There's probably a simple numerical method to solve the question...

#####Remarks
I was planning on adding actual error checking and tests to my first attempt (for practice) 
until I realized it was going on the wrong track.
